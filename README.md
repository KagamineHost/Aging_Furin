# FURIN stimulates NOTCH2 and NOTCH3 Pathways Leading to Return of Function in Aged Muscle Cells

This repository contains the codes for the original analysis used in paper "FURIN stimulates NOTCH2 and NOTCH3 Pathways Leading to Return of Function in Aged Muscle Cells".

## Purpose

This Github Repo exists for the purpose of giving individuals the ability to reproduce the findings and figures found in the previously named paper. All code was written by Jiaxing Liu and as a result any issues with the Github should be directed towards him via issues or email correspodence.

## Data Availability

The raw datasets analyzed in this study are publicly available through the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project (https://gtexportal.org/). Data can be accessed via the GTEx Portal or via our UBox cloud storage upon request.
